Type, compile, and run the following program implementing linked list using pointersutilizing Queue data structure. Queue is First-In First-Out (FIFO)1. 
A parking garage has a one-way entrance and one-way exit. It has only one lane to parkcars. The capacity of the parking is for 10 cars. 
Each car’s record is as follow:struct Car{string Owner_Name;string Licence_Plate;string Car_Model;int Ticket_Number;int Check-in;int Check_Out;};
Your program should have the following functions:
1. Read data including Check In time.
2. Push one car at a time to rear
3. To pop, read Check Out time first. 
The charge for the parking is as follow:
• 0 – 30 Minutes $3.00
• 31 Minutes – 59 Minutes $5.00
• 1 hour – 5 hours $10.00
• 6 hours – 12 hours $15.00
• More than 12 hours $20.0
04. Calculate the charge for each car. Add 15% tip to the charge.5. If the parking lot is not full, then your program should allow more cars to beparked.
6. Calculate the total money made by 10 cars in one day.
7. Repeat this for seven days.
8. There is 55 % overhead.
9. Calculate Monthly and yearly Net income.
10. Predict the annual income generated from parking garage.
